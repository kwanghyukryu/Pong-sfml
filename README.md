### PONG
I have created the game pong using the c++ library SFML.

using the sfml library, I have created the ball which will bounce off of any surface it hits as well as a paddle that can be controlled by the players with the keys "A" and "D".

The ball will gradually speed up as it hits the paddle and resets when player is not able to bounce it back.

I have also created a life and point system.
Player will start with 3lives and each time they fail to bounce it back, the lives will go down.
Each time the players bounce it back, the point will increase.
